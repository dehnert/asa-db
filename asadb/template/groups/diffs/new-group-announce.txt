{% autoescape off %}On behalf of the Association of Student Activities (ASA) we welcome:

   {{group.name}}

to the MIT community!

Your group is currently *suspended*. The last step to finalize the group
recognition is for you to finish entering the group's complete information into
the ASA Database:

      http://web.mit.edu/asa/www/asa-db.shtml

Your group's entry is at:

      https://asa.mit.edu{% url "groups:group-detail" group.pk %}

You should make sure to do the following:
* add membership numbers
* put your constitution somewhere permanent (preferably in your group's Athena
  locker, {{group.athena_locker}}) and list the new location in the DB

You may also want to:
* add your website and meeting times so potential members can find
  you more easily
* add any group officers who should be able to reserve rooms, update your DB
  entry, etc.

Note that at this point only the President and Treasurer of the group
({{officer_emails|join:", "}})
can modify the information and that MIT personal certificates are
required to access the group's account in the ASA Database.

Once you have completed these steps, you must *notify asa-groups@mit.edu* to
become an active group.

*** Please keep this e-mail for further reference. ***

Important information follows about the creation of e-mail accounts
and lists for your group, as well as campus resources available to you
as an ASA-recognized group. Please read carefully. Mail has been sent
to accounts@mit.edu informing them that you have been approved by the
ASA and they will create your locker and e-mail accounts as needed.

The Athena locker for {{group.name}} will be :

      {{group.athena_locker}}

The officer's e-mail list :

      {{group.officer_email}}

It will administrate the Athena locker and the general email list.
It is important that you keep the officer's list current, as it
will administer the locker and the general e-mail list, as well as
allow both the ASA and the Student Activities staff to get in touch
with you.

The general e-mail list :

      {{group.group_email}}

Lastly, this e-mail has been cc'd to funds@mit.edu.  That address
reaches the staff of the Student Activities Finances Office who will
help you setup the group's main account and funding account, as well
as provide you with help to obtain advanced payments or reimbursements
for your group's need.

We also direct your attention to the resources available to you through
the Student Activities staff in W20-549. As part of the Student Life
Program office, the Student Activities staff is available
to provide event-planning assistance, advice on organizational issues,
leadership development opportunities, and information about campus
resources.  Please feel free to drop by and further acquaint yourself
with the office and staff.

Sincerely,

The ASA Executive Board
