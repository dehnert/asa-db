{% autoescape off %}Hi officers of {{obj.display_name}},
   Somebody recently submitted a FYSM entry on behalf of your group. We'd like to encourage you to review your entry as it appears on the FYSM website main page (http://asa.scripts.mit.edu/forms/fysm/, any relevant category pages, and in the slide view (http://asa.mit.edu{% url "fysm-view" obj.year obj.pk %}). You can return to http://asa.mit.edu{% url "fysm-manage" obj.pk %} to make any changes you wish to make; please do so by the end of Thursday.
{% if results %}
We performed an automated scan of your entry to try to detect common problems.

We've attempted to mark the priority of the issues; high indicates that we're fairly confident that you have an issue, and if you don't fix it we may do so ourselves, or punt you from the FYSM; medium indicates that we're either fairly confident that you'll want to make a change because it'll look better, or suspect that you have an issue that might cause us to punt you from the FYSM if unchanged; and low means that we think you might have something to change to make you look better.

The results are:
{% for result in results %}* {{result.heading}} [{{result.level}}]
{% endfor %}
{% for result in results %}
== {{result.heading}} [{{result.level}}] ==
{{result.body}}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}
Thanks,
ASA FYSM team
