<h2><a name='components'></a>Components</h2>

<h3><a name='components-hazing'></a>1. Anti-Hazing Law</h3>

<p>All groups are required to submit an annual acknowledgement of compliance with Massachusetts anti-hazing law.  The <a href='#ma-law'>text of the law</a> is at the bottom of this page.</p>

<h3><a name='components-nondiscrim'></a>2. Non-Discrimination Policy</h3>

<p>All groups are required to comply with the MIT Non-Discrimination Policy.  Specifically, groups are prohibited from discriminating against individuals on the basis of race, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, disability, age, genetic information, veteran status, ancestry, or national or ethnic origin.  <a href="http://web.mit.edu/referencepubs/nondiscrimination/">The full text of the policy is available</a>.</p>

<h3><a name='components-membership'></a>3. Providing Membership Information</h3>

<p>We are requiring that groups provide membership information &ndash; both membership definition and the corresponding numbers. This information is important for our understanding of your group and ensuring that groups are meeting our membership standards. We will also share the membership numbers with the funding boards (GSC, UA, and LEF/ARCADE) for groups that apply to those sources. <strong>It is very important you are honest when answering these questions</strong>, even if you are concerned your membership does not meet our standards. We will provide time and support for groups to improve their student participation as needed &ndash; both in terms of number and proportion of students. Groups that are shown to be dishonest in this process, particularly with regards to meeting our standards, <strong>may have funding and space eligibility revoked or be suspended or derecognized</strong>.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Minimum definition of member</dt><dd><p>For the purposes of this form, the minimum definition of membership you use should include only people who (a) you would expect to confirm membership in your group (not that they all have to) if asked and (b) you consider to be regular or active members of your group. Members should satisfy both (a) and (b); you should not count members who satisfy only one or the other. (You may be more stringent, based on how your group views or defines membership internally.) You must state the specific definition of membership you are using below. This does not need to be a membership definition that is in your constitution.</p></dd>

<dt>Recruitment</dt><dd><p>If you are still in the midst of or leading up to your major recruitment period, we encourage you to submit current numbers soon to ensure you have something submitted before the deadline. Then you can submit an updated form later, either before or after the deadline. You don't need to do this if your membership changes slightly, but we recommend you do so if your numbers change significantly.</p></dd>

</dl>

<h3><a name='components-confirm'></a>4. Membership Confirmation</h3>

<p>In addition to the membership info provided by you above, please have at least five student members confirm membership using the link below. You do not need to have everyone do this; we are simply looking for <em>five students'</em> confirmation. Once you submit this form, you will be able to <a href='{% url "membership-submitted" %}'>see how many have confirmed already</a>.</p>

<p>Link to provide to members: <a href='{{confirm_uri}}'>{{confirm_uri}}</a>.</p>

<p>If you have any questions or concerns, please email <strong>asa-exec@mit.edu</strong>.</p>

<h2><a name='ma-law'></a>Text of Anti-Hazing Law</h2>

<p>All student groups must have a representative sign this ASA Anti-Hazing Form to confirm that the group will not sponsor or involve its members in acts of hazing, in compliance with Massachusetts Law. The text of the law is below. You must also provide the email for your group membership and this text will be distributed to your group (as required) automatically.</p>

<h3>Section 17. Hazing; organizing or participating; hazing defined:</h3>
<p>Whoever is a principal organizer or participant in the crime of hazing, as defined herein, shall be punished by a fine of not more than three thousand dollars 
or by imprisonment in a house of correction for not more than one year, or both such fine and imprisonment.  The term "hazing" as used in this section and in 
sections eighteen and nineteen, shall mean any conduct or method of initiation into any student organization, whether on public or private property, which 
willfully or recklessly endangers the physical or mental health of any student or other person. Such conduct shall include whipping, beating, branding, forced 
calisthenics, exposure to the weather, forced consumption of any food, liquor, beverage, drug or other substance, or any other brutal treatment or forced 
physical activity which is likely to adversely affect the physical health or safety of any such student or other person, or which subjects such student or 
other person to extreme mental stress, including extended deprivation of sleep or rest or extended isolation.  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this 
section to the contrary, consent shall not be available as a defense to any prosecution under this action. </p>

<h3>Section 18. Failure to report hazing:</h3>
<p>
Whoever knows that another person is the victim of hazing as defined in section seventeen and is at the scene of such crime shall, to the extent that such 
person can do so without danger or peril to himself or others, report such crime to an appropriate law enforcement official as soon as reasonably practicable. 
Whoever fails to report such crime shall be punished by a fine of not more than one thousand dollars.</p>

<h3>Section 19. Copy of Secs. 17 to 19; issuance to students and student groups, teams and organizations; report:</h3>
<p>
Each institution of secondary education and each public and private institution of post secondary education shall issue to every student group, student team or 
student organization which is part of such institution or is recognized by the institution or permitted by the institution to use its name or facilities or is 
known by the institution to exist as an unaffiliated student group, student team or student organization, a copy of this section and sections seventeen and 
eighteen; provided, however, that an institution's compliance with this section's requirements that an institution issue copies of this section and sections 
seventeen and eighteen to unaffiliated student groups, teams or organizations shall not constitute evidence of the institution's recognition or endorsement of 
said unaffiliated student groups, teams or organizations.</p>
<p>
Each such group, team or organization shall distribute a copy of this section and sections seventeen and eighteen to each of its members, plebes, pledges or 
applicants for membership. It shall be the duty of each such group, team or organization, acting through its designated officer, to deliver annually, to the 
institution <i>[in MIT's case the Office of Student Life Programs (with exception of varsity teams and club sports, who will deliver attested
acknowledgements to the Department of Athletics, Physical Education and Recreation)]</i> an attested acknowledgement stating that such group, team or 
organization has received a copy of this section and said sections seventeen and eighteen, that each of its members, plebes, pledges, or applicants has received 
a copy of sections seventeen and eighteen, and that such group, team or organization understands and agrees to comply with the provisions of this
section and sections seventeen and eighteen.</p>
<p>
Each institution of secondary education and each public or private institution of post secondary education shall, at least annually, before or at the start of 
enrollment, deliver to each person who enrolls as a full time student in such institution a copy of this section and sections seventeen and eighteen.</p>
<p>
Each institution of secondary education and each public or private institution of post secondary education shall file, at least annually, a report with the 
board of higher education and in the case of secondary institutions, the board of education, certifying that such institution has complied with its 
responsibility to inform student groups, teams or organizations and to notify each full time student enrolled by it of the provisions of this section and 
sections seventeen and eighteen and also certifying that said institution has adopted a disciplinary policy with regard to the organizers and participants of 
hazing, and that such policy has been set forth with appropriate emphasis in the student handbook or similar means of communicating the institution's policies 
to its students. The board of higher education and, in the case of secondary institutions, the board of education shall promulgate regulations governing the 
content and frequency of such reports, and shall forthwith report to the attorney general any such institution which fails to make such report.
